# RePost

## Description
RePost is a 'social media' application developed using React. It utilises a 'mock' database to manage user accounts, including user registration and login. You are allowed to use, share, or modify it as you wish, but **commercial use, such as selling, is prohibited.**

## Features
On RePost, you can:
- Sign up for an account
- Log in to your account

More features may be added in the future.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
You will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). 

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the RePost repository to your local machine.
2. Open your project in VSCode (or any IDE you use).

### Commands to Run
1. Create a new Vite project:
``npm create vite@latest``

2. When prompted, enter a name for your project. Choose React and JavaScript (navigate using the arrow keys and select with Enter).

3. Navigate to the depository and run the commands:
``cd '.\repost v1.0\'``
``npm install``
``npm install react-router-dom``
``npm run dev``

And voilà! You can now use RePost.

## Collaboration
I appreciate your interest in collaborating on this project. However, I have been learning React for only a few weeks, and much of the code may be "spaghetti code." I might consider collaboration in the future once I gain more experience and become more comfortable with React.

## Additional Information
As mentioned earlier, this website uses a mock database. This 'database' is simply a list of JavaScript objects storing user information such as names, passwords, and emails. **DO NOT DO THIS IN A REAL-WORLD APPLICATION! Always use a proper database when developing a website to avoid security issues.**
